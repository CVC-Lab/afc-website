Within this\ncontext, our research has developed two innovative methods that have relevance\nto this problem domain, even though they have not been directly applied to\nEO/IR video and RF-ITV streams. Both contributions represent significant\nadvancements in optimization and data handling that align with the requirements\nof on-the-fly sampling and compression <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. The integration of these methods\ninto the specific domain of EO/IR video and RF-ITV streams warrants further\ninvestigation, potentially leading to substantial improvements in efficiency,\nflexibility, and robustness of the associated processes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-particle-based-sparse-gaussian-process-optimizer\">A Particle-based Sparse Gaussian Process Optimizer</h2>\n<p>The first method introduced in this domain is a Particle-based Sparse Gaussian\nProcess Optimizer (Bajaj et al., 2022). Traditional swarm-based\noptimization methods, while successful in many applications, can suffer\ninefficiency or local-minima entrapment. In order to overcome these challenges,\nwe developed a new framework that utilizes Gaussian Process Regression to gain\na deeper understanding of the underlying dynamical process of descent.</p>\n<p>This method offers greater exploration around the current state before\ndetermining the direction of descent. Such an explorative approach has the\npotential to escape from local minima, allowing for more robust optimization.\nWe empirically showed the superiority of our method in non-convex optimization\nscenarios and tested its applicability in high-dimensional spaces, such as\nimage classification. Further, it has a potential application to the sampling\nand compression of EO/IR Video and RF-ITV Streams.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learning-generative-embeddings-using-an-optimal-subsampling-policy-for-tensor-sketching\">Learning Generative Embeddings using an Optimal Subsampling Policy for Tensor Sketching</h2>\n<p>The second contribution to on-the-fly sampling is our research \"Learning\nGenerative Embeddings using an Optimal Subsampling Policy for Tensor Sketching\"\n(Bajaj et al., 2022). With data tensors of order 3 and above becoming\nincreasingly prevalent, particularly in fields like images, videos, and\ngeographic data, accessing such large data collections has become increasingly\nprohibitive.</p>\n<p>Our proposed method learns approximate full-rank and compact tensor sketches,\nproviding efficient space, time, and spectral embeddings. By constructing\ntensor sketches from a sample-efficient sub-sampling of tensor slices, and\nemploying an adaptable stochastic Thompson sampling with Dirichlet\ndistributions and conjugate priors, we manage to produce optimal rank-r Tucker\ndecompositions.</p>\n<p>The implications of this method in the context of on-the-fly sampling and\ncompression of EO/IR Video and RF-ITV Streams can be seen in the efficient\nhandling and querying of large data collections. The use of generative sketches\nallows for streamlined processing without losing critical information, a\ncrucial aspect in the real-time handling of such complex data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bajaj, C., Heo, T., &#x26; Avlur, R.
