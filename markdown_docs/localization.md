# Real Time Localization

Real-time localization remains a crucial aspect of the project, significantly
contributing to the efficiency and accuracy of detection and tracking in
defense applications. This process involves the precise determination of object
positions within a given space, in real time, thereby enabling rapid response
to dynamic scenarios.

In our context, the real-time localization process has been substantially
informed by recent advancements in the field. Specifically, the integration of
DeblurSR (Song et al., 2023) and E-CIR (Song et al., 2022) methodologies
offer promising avenues for enhancing the localization capabilities.

The DeblurSR method, detailed in
section [DeblurSR](../signature-detection.html#deblursr-event-based-motion-deblurring-under-the-spiking),
provides innovative techniques for super-resolution and deblurring, thereby
improving the image clarity required for precise location determination. By
applying these advancements, the reliability of our localization process can be
significantly augmented.

Similarly, the E-CIR framework, discussed in
section [E-CIR](../integration.html#e-cir-event-enhanced-continuous-intensity-recovery),
introduces novel concepts of information
retrieval and object recognition within electronic circuits. These principles
can be adapted to improve the computational efficiency of the real-time
localization process.

The integration of these methodologies into our real-time localization module
(referenced in Milestone 8 in Table~\ref{tab:milestones}) demonstrates our
commitment to employing state-of-the-art techniques. These inclusions not only
reflect the current progress in the project (colored in light green in Table~
\ref{tab:milestones}) but also outline the direction of our remaining tasks (
colored in light blue in Table~\ref{tab:milestones}).
